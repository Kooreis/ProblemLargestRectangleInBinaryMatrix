# Question: How do you determine the largest rectangle in a binary matrix filled with 1s? JavaScript Summary

The JavaScript function `maxArea` calculates the area of the largest rectangle filled with 1s in a binary matrix. The function first checks if the matrix is empty, returning 0 if it is. It then initializes the variables `m` and `n` to the number of rows and columns in the matrix, respectively. Three arrays `left`, `right`, and `height` are created to store the leftmost, rightmost, and height of the rectangle at each column. The variable `maxA` is used to keep track of the maximum area found so far. The function then iterates over each row of the matrix. For each row, it updates the `height` array based on the current row's values. It then updates the `left` and `right` arrays, which keep track of the leftmost and rightmost boundaries of the rectangle at each column. Finally, it calculates the area of the rectangle at each column and updates `maxA` if a larger area is found. The function returns `maxA`, which is the area of the largest rectangle filled with 1s in the matrix.

# TypeScript Differences

The TypeScript version of the solution uses a different approach to solve the problem compared to the JavaScript version. The JavaScript version uses dynamic programming to calculate the maximum area of the rectangle, while the TypeScript version uses a stack-based approach to find the maximum area under the histogram representation of the binary matrix.

In terms of language features, the TypeScript version uses classes and type annotations, which are not available in JavaScript. The Stack class in the TypeScript version encapsulates the stack operations (push, pop, peek, isEmpty), and type annotations are used to ensure that the correct types of data are used in the functions and methods.

The TypeScript version also uses a helper function, `maxHistogramArea`, to calculate the maximum area under a histogram, which is then used in the `maxRectangle` function to find the maximum rectangle in the binary matrix. This is a different approach compared to the JavaScript version, which calculates the maximum area directly in the `maxArea` function.

In terms of methods, both versions use similar methods such as `push`, `pop`, `isEmpty`, and `Math.max`. However, the TypeScript version uses the `peek` method to get the top element of the stack, which is not used in the JavaScript version.

Overall, the TypeScript version provides a more structured and type-safe solution to the problem compared to the JavaScript version.

# C++ Differences

The C++ version of the solution uses a different approach to solve the problem compared to the JavaScript version. 

The JavaScript version uses dynamic programming to solve the problem. It maintains three arrays: `left`, `right`, and `height` to keep track of the leftmost, rightmost boundaries and the height of the rectangle at each column. It then iterates over the matrix row by row, updating these arrays and calculating the maximum area of the rectangle at each step.

On the other hand, the C++ version uses a stack-based approach to solve the problem. It first calculates the maximum area of the histogram for the first row using the `maxHist` function. Then, for each subsequent row, it updates the row values by adding the value from the previous row if the current value is 1, and then calculates the maximum area of the histogram for the updated row. The maximum of these areas is the area of the largest rectangle in the binary matrix.

In terms of language features, the C++ version uses a stack from the Standard Template Library (STL) to keep track of the indices of the bars in the histogram. It also uses arrays to store the matrix and the rows for the histogram, and uses the `max` function from the STL to calculate the maximum area. The JavaScript version, on the other hand, uses arrays to store the matrix and the left, right, and height values, and uses the `Math.max` and `Math.min` functions to calculate the maximum and minimum values.

The C++ version also uses standard input/output for reading the matrix and printing the result, while the JavaScript version uses a predefined matrix and console logging.
